BART-google_map
===============
This was a personal, side project implemented using a localhost server (XAMPP). 
The goal was to learn how to use a large, public API, AJAX, and some PHP.

-------------------------
Key Concepts:

Javascript, AJAX, php, SQL database connection, google map API.

-------------------------
Function:

AJAX based interactive google map that displays real time, xml fed Bay Area Rapid Transit Lines, Stations and  Arrival / DepartureTimes.

-------------------------
Methodology:

Uses php, ajax, JS and SQL to dynamically download station arrival / departure times into a database, and then 
display those data using Javascript and the google map API. 
Station polylines and points are prestored in a SQL database since those are constant.
